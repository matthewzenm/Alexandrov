\chapter{Preface}

This is a highly intensive and quick seminar on metric geometry, particularly on basic Riemannian geometry and Alexandrov spaces.
Only prerequisite of this seminar is basic calculus and linear algebra, with adequate mathematical maturity.
For simpler typesetting, we do not draw any pictures.

We plan to introduce general topology first, then introduce metric spaces and length spaces, together with Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
After this, we discuss some basic Riemannian manifolds, preparing for later discussion.
As we are well-prepared, we begin our tour on Alexandrov spaces, with plenty of examples.
(to be continued\dots)

We follow mainly \emph{A course in metric geometry} of Burago et al.\ for general metric geometry, and \emph{An introduction of the geometry of Alexandrov spaces} of Shiohama for Alexandrov spaces.
